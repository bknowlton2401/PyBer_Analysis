# PyBer_Analysis
To analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization

## Programs used
Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis 
The purpose of this analysis is to use Python, Pnadas and Matplotlib to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type,  a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results 

![Summary_data_frame](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96890065/160301121-47ead309-f949-474d-8343-c87ec61da837.JPG)

To begin our analysis, we first found the total rides, total drivers and total fares for each city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). The data that is shown, it is not surprising that there are more total rides and total drivers in an urban city type then a rural or suburban city type.  

The data also shows us that there is opportunity to grow the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities.  The total amount of rides given compared to the total number of drivers is higher. From a drivers perspective, this means they have ample opportunities to pick up more fares and to earn more money.  For riders in a rural or suburban city, they will pay $5 to $10 more per ride than someone in an urban city.  With more drivers available and most likely shorter distances to drive, the fares are lower in an urban city.  


## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Based on these results, I would recommended the following:
* Increase advertising for driving opportunities in rural and suburban areas.
  * Advertising both the demand for drivers and the possible earnings could attract drivers
* Run an anaylsis on distance driven in all three city types.
  * Determining the average distance traveled for all three city types will help to determine if drivers in rural and suburban cities are losing out on fares due to total distance traveled.
* An investigation on why riders use PyBer in rural and suburban cities.
  * In urban cities, riders may be using PyBer to commute to work, whereas in rural and suburban riders may be using PyBer for safety (designated driver) reasons.  Understanding why, may help increase drivers and rides.
