# PyBer_Analysis
To analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization

## Programs used
Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis 
The purpose of this analysis is to use Python, Pnadas and Matplotlib to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type,  a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results 
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
